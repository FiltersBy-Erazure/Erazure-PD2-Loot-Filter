# **Differences Between Filter Level Tiers:**

**Tier 1 = Lowest Strictness:**

- This filter level is recommended for the ladder start and for characters level 1-80 as it shows all magic and rare items.
- When your character exceeds specific level thresholds, some low-value non-magical items start to get filtered out.

**Tier 2 = Fewer Magic Items:**

- **Magic and Rare Items:**
  - Low-value magic and rare items are hidden when your character exceeds specific level thresholds.
    - Generally, these thresholds are at character level 40+ for normal-tier items.
  - Normal-tier magic armors/boots/gloves/etc start to be hidden. 
  - Some ethereal magic class items (for example: barb helms, druid pelts, necro shields, paladin shields) are hidden.
  - Normal-tier non-ethereal magic and rare weapons that are deemed not useful for crafting are hidden.
- **Non-Magical Items:**
  - Some non-ethereal non-superior (or superior without %ED) non-magical weapons are filtered out.
- **Miscellaneous:**
  - Every 5 levels after character level 80, filtering applies to larger gold piles.
  - Scrolls of TP and ID are hidden at character levels 80+

**Tier 3 = Strict Filtering:**

- **Magic and Rare Items:**
  - Filtering for magic and rare items becomes more strict when your character exceeds specific level thresholds
    - Generally, these thresholds are at character level 80+ for exceptional-tier items and 90+ for elite-tier
  - Select exceptional and elite-tier magic/rare armors and weapons (particularly non-ethereal weapons) are hidden past specific level thresholds.
  - Normal-tier non-ethereal magic/rare weapons that are deemed not useful for crafting are hidden.
  - Magic ethereal armors, belts, boots, and gloves are filtered out
  - Non-ethereal magic amazon javelins are hidden unless your character is an Amazon
  - Ethereal craftable throwing weapons no longer notify unless your character is a Barbarian
  - Magic class items are hidden unless you character can use them
  - Magic arrows are hidden
  - Magic rings are hidden
- **Set Items:**
  - Low-value normal-tier set items (except for Death's gloves and belt, and Tancred's boots) will get filtered out. Non-desirable exceptional and elite-tier set items will show but not notify upon drop.
- **Non-Magical Items:**
  - Many non-magical armor and weapon bases without %ED are hidden, however this does not apply to select useful runeword bases (e.g. ethereal)
  - When your character is level 90+, non-useful non-magical items with staffmods are hidden if they aren't good runeword bases
  - Ethereal non-magical throwing weapons (that are corruptible for a 50% chance to create a crafting base) are hidden
  - Non-magical 1-socket class items are hidden
- **Miscellaneous:**
  - Antidote and thawing potions will be hidden (unless the character is in the zones pertaining to the Rathma fight)
  - Every 5 levels after character level 80, filtering applies to larger gold piles.

**Tier 4 = Endgame Mapping:**
- **Gems:**
  - Flawless gem stacks with quantity of 1 are hidden
- **Runes:**
  - Runes between El - Io will show but no longer notify upon drop, however map icons will remain visible

- **Magic and Rare Items:**
  - Rare arrows and bolts are hidden unless your character is an Amazon
  - Rare paladin shields are hidden unless you character is a Paladin
  - All magic class items are hidden
  - Magic amulets are hidden
- **Set Items:**
  - Set rings and amulets are hidden
- **Non-Magical Items:**

  - Non-ethereal non-magical paladin shields with less than 30 all res are hidden
- **Miscellaneous:**
